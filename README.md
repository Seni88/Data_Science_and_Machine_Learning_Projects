# Data Science and Machine Learning Project Portfolio
This repository contains a portfolio of Data Science and Machine Learning projects that were completed by me for academic and self learning purposes. 

The datasets used in these projects are for demostration purposes.

## Instructions
- Download Python and Anaconda to be able to access Jupyter Notebooks to write the necassary codes.
- You can also use Google Colabs which is a Jupyter notebook environment which can be better to create and run the Machine Learning models.
- Comet ML is another platform that enables you to manage, visualize and optimize models from training runs to production monitoring.

## Projects

### [Spain Electricity Shortfall](https://github.com/Seni88/Data_Science_and_Machine_Learning_Projects/tree/main/Spain%20Electricity%20Shortfall%20Challenge):

- Objective
  - Built a Predictive Model for the shortfall between the energy generated by means of fossil fuels and various renewable sources for the country of Spain.

- Implementation
  - Firstly, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to uncover the underlying structure of the dataset (data types, dimension, summary statistics, etc.)
  - Next the dataset was cleaned, where null values and outliers were removed.

- Challenges
  - There were too many features present, therefore Feature Engineering was performed in order to reduce the number of features and improve the multicollinearity issue.

- Solutions
  - Built a Random Forest Model that had a R-Squared score of 0.68 which indicates the accuracy of the model.

### [Climate Change Belief App](https://github.com/Seni88/Data_Science_and_Machine_Learning_Projects/tree/main/Climate%20Change%20Belief%20App):

- Objective
  - Built a Natural Language Processing (NLP) Model that performed Sentiment Analysis. The model classified a person’s belief in climate change based on the person’s Twitter data.

- Implementation
  - During the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase of the project, the different sentiment types; positive, negative and neutral, were determined.
  - The dataset was “dirty”, where there were duplicated words and unnecessary words (‘an’, ‘the’, etc.), therefore they were removed during the data cleaning phase.
  - Tokenization and Lametization was performed to prepare the data for the Modelling phase of the project.

- Challenges
  - Computers can’t interpret  texts, therefore texts (categorical data) was changed to numbers (numerical data) for better analysis and modelling.

- Solutions
  - Built a Logistic Regression Model that had an accuracy score of 98% and a F1 Score of 0.66 which measures the models performance.

### [South African Language Identification](https://github.com/Seni88/Data_Science_and_Machine_Learning_Projects/tree/main/South%20African%20Language%20Identification):

- Objective
  - Built a Natural Language Processing (NLP) Model that performed Sentiment Analysis where the model had to identify which South African Language the data was in and classify the data into the correct group.
  
- Implementation
  - During the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase of the project, 11 different language were identified.
  - Histograms helped view the distribution of data of each language.
  
- Challenges
  - Computers can’t interpret  texts, therefore texts (categorical data) was changed to numbers (numerical data) for better analysis and modelling.
  
- Solutions
  - Built a Multinomial Naive Bayes Model that had an accuracy score of 99% and a F1 Score of 0.99 which measures the models performance.

### [Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/Seni88/Data_Science_and_Machine_Learning_Projects/tree/main/Movie%20Recommendation%20App):

- Objective
  - Built a Recommender System, centered on collaborative filtering, that accurately predicts how a user will rate a movie based on their historical preferences.
  
- Implementation
  - During the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase of the project, different genres and number of ratings were determined.
  - During the feature engineering phase, the dataset was scaled and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed to simplify the complexity of the high dimensionality of the dataset.
  - During the Modeling phase, models based on collaborative filtering and content-based filtering were compared.
  
- Challenges
  - Reducing the size of the dataset affected the model performance, therefore the model will later be exposed to unseen data without sampling and see how it performed.

- Solutions
  - Built a SVD Model that performed better than the other models. It produced a RMSE score of 0.97.
