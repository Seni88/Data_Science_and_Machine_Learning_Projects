# Data Science and Machine Learning Project Portfolio
This repository contains a portfolio of Data Science and Machine Learning projects that were completed by me for academic and self learning purposes. 

The datasets used in these projects are for demostration purposes.

## Instructions
- Download Python and Anaconda to be able to access Jupyter Notebooks to write the necassary codes.
- You can also use Google Colabs which is a Jupyter notebook environment which can be better to create and run the Machine Learning models.
- Comet ML is another platform that enables you to manage, visualize and optimize models from training runs to production monitoring.
